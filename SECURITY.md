# Security Policy

Miralium Research takes security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a
security vulnerability in MCP Security Report, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

To report a security vulnerability, contact us by email at
`security@miralium.re`. When submitting your report, include "MCP Security
Report Vulnerability" in the subject line to help us prioritize your message.

In your email, describe the vulnerability in detail, outlining the steps
required to reproduce the issue, the potential impact, and the versions
affected. If possible, attach any relevant proof-of-concept code or supporting
materials that can assist our team in verifying and addressing the problem.

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. We will work with you to understand and verify the vulnerability
2. We will develop and test a fix
3. We will release the fix and publish a security advisory
4. We will publicly acknowledge your contribution (if desired)

Please do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance
to address it.
